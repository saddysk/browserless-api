Feel free to restructure and reorder the flow of the text if it helps increase the clarity of the content.
    
    Remember these very important points:
    1. give as much as context possible from the input text, also try to give examples and references used in the text provided to you
    2. if the ouput still comes in english, make sure to translate it in ${outputLanguage} language. So remember, the result (summary) should be only and only in ${outputLanguage} language.
    3. the summary should very very crisp & short, and the total word count of the response should be less than 15% of the total word count of the actual text content provided to you.
    4. make sure to add paragraphs, line breaks and display in bullets wherever possible for the ease of reading for the user.
